The final work is individual or in a group of two (but double work is expected; both must submit the files in moodle). It is open but it must be an application of the core concepts and tools proposed throughout the course. The grade is based on:

  - Suitability of the case of study as an IoT-based system that needs to perform a function (30%)
  - Proper use of the concepts from lecture notes (40%)
  - Ability to use the computational tools suitable for the proposed study (30%)
