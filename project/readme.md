The final work is individual or in a group of two (but double work is expected; both must submit the files in moodle). It is open but it must be an application of the core concepts and tools proposed throughout the course. The grade is based on:

  - Suitability of the case of study as an IoT-based system that needs to perform a function (30%)
  - Proper use of the concepts from lecture notes (40%)
  - Ability to use the computational tools suitable for the proposed study (30%)

The soil NPK sensor is suitable for detecting the content of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the soil. It helps in determining the fertility of the soil thereby facilitating the systematic assessment of the soil condition. The sensor can be buried in the soil for a long time.
